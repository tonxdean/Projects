Summary: Create a linked list linked by several different attributes.

Execution looks something like:

./radioDS.out TinyLibrary.txt input.txt out_library.txt out_songgroup.txt out_print.txt

The first argument is a file that contains the Library data. The second argument is a file contains a list of
commands, which you can assume are always formatted correctly. The third file is where output for libraryrelated
commands will be saved. The fourth file is similarly a file for output from Song Group commands,
and finally the fifth file holds output from  “print” commands.
